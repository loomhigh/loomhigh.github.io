## Hi, I'm Loomhigh.

I am whimsical, unfortunately.
I have done one thing, then another, then another.

### Brief backstory
When I was 16 I started a youtube channel. I am older now and make less videos.

At some point I started using blender, not so much these days.

Now I am into Linux (I use Arch btw). Though I am not super technically minded.

I've also been a bit political (as a treat) in my ventures there I've seen what activism and campaigns are like. I want to do that for Linux.

Then the present happened, and what a gift that is.

### Projects

I always have "Projects". Things I want to do. Most of it never gets done, at least not to satisfaction, but boy am I never bored with life.

### Tutorials

I want to document how I did things with Linux as much as possible so that no one else has to suffer through the things I did. At the moment tutorials are sparse, but they will be coming.

### Writings

Contains my creative writing and any emotive pieces made, such as for motions and articles and such.
