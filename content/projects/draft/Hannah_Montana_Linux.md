### Sims 4 ###

* Scene: On a pirate ship dressed as pirate pete

"are yee scurvy doge"
Qwerty: "hey, who are you calling doge"
"shut yer yap"
Let me tell you the famous pirate battle between old pirate pete and the famed scourge of the EA seas Captain Anadius, for the sacred treasure of Sims 4"
"This great game has raptured many a fair soul. In the Sims 4, you build your very own Lotus Hotel. Posessing this treasure is all fine and dandy, but the real question is, can it set sail in this old vessel of ours?"

*BudgetPC builds voice*  
“Lets see how it looks in the benchmarks”
  - Zooming into the screen of video game footage with expressive hands visible on the sides
### Borderlands 2 ###

* barbenheimer vibes, switching between barbie and oppenheimer presentation.

Next on the squad is borderlands 2. 
To really get the game to POP I started with an explosive Axton build on medium settings. The life of a soldier is not a life of glory, one wonders what life would have been like if he never had to go AWOL, after blowing awto the wind both captors and hostages alike. What made him do that? The glory? The game? Why live a double life when you can chose to end many more instead. *nuclear explosion*

Krieg: The Chaos and the yearning, moving, twitching, salivation! All to test its cartilage in the cockpit of battle! Colours and flavours so tasty, so BURNING. There is no greater princess than what came from the FIRE and AGONY and unvieled BLOOOD. 

*Gaige starts off Barbie and transitions to oppenheimer*
Gaige: Why embrace the patriarchal order to middling two lives when you can live in total ANARCHY. With your new trusty hardware sidekick you can boast reliable framerates even with double bouncing bullets and the ultimate crime of half empty weapon clips.
It may take eyeshadow, a present father figure, and a life under the order of agents to become a true superstar, but when you embrace anarchy. When the shadows on your face are three bags full, when the only presence in your life is your own, and the only agency you obey is destruction, dismantlement, the basest of systems where no man can dominate over another. That is when you are a girlboss.

### Rimworld ###
*Country accent*  
Survival does not inherently depend on such vain luxuries as the 7500M Radeon GPU, which cuts through graphics like a bony little weed whacker. To live out the Rim all you really need is a single thread to control your fate. With Rimworld we can see that in action. This little laptop, designed to manage its heat resources will strive to survive on maximum speed and stoicly moderated Hetz.

### Doki Doki Literature club ##

Whats linux machine without Virtualisation functionality? Today we will try running RealityOS. This operating system uses an open BSD type kernel and its latest release, v2.1.2, is a proprietary fork developed by the FORAD corporation. As we can see the desktop environment boots up fine. Now RealityOS is meant to be an immutable operating system, deleting files is not recommended and can cause weird bugs. Not to fret though as the image does come with a Cutesy little dating game for us to test out. Anime adventures aren't quite my cup of tea, but for all you hopeless romantics out there it seems like a wonderful little adventure from the parts of it I have played.
