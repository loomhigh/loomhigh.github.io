## Emotion, Values, Leadership 
<!--Page 60-->
 Decisions are based on value judgements which requires <mark>emotional information</mark>.
- Some emotions `enable` intention, mindfulness, and urgency
- some emotions `inhibit` intention, mindfulness, and agency.

Leaders goal is enabling others to be `motivated` enough by a disruption to result in `action` and make that action ` mindful` not `reactionary`.

Emotion, even negatives like anxiety, breaks habit. Consistency bias "It's always worked this way" and apathy "nothing we do works anyway" are disrupted by emotional shock.

> EMOTION: MOTIVATES, BREAKS INERTIA, OVEROMES BIAS.

### Urgency and Anger
<!--Page 63-->

The job of a leader in any movement is to activate people's need for urgent and intentional action, even when there is no apparent urgency and no clear conscious action.

> this is done by pointing out contradictions in shared assumptions on how the world is, **agitation.**

Urgency establishes **priorities**. The two types of urgency are:
- URGENCY OF NEED: made when things are so bad that action is needed **now**
- URGENCY OF OPPORTUNITY: Made with **deadlines**. when you need to do something by a certain time for it to have an effect.

Anger counters Apathy and inertia via outrage.
> The world as it is rubbing up against the world as it should be.

Actions that cause outrage:
- Domination
- Discrimination
- Bullying
- Violation
- Neglect  

Regardless of how legitimate these actions appear to be, they will cause `outrage.`

Percieved destruction of values, moral traditions, and dignity are sources of anger that can motivate action

>`I have yet to really put these theories in action. If I do, I will add the example and how it went in practice here`

## Public Narrative
### Why me? Why us? Why now?

Everyones favorite part about politics, and what most people see it all as: Stories.

The reality is that people are far more likely to get with the program if they <i>"get"</i> you, the programmer.

You need to be able to tell a story of self that allows people to *"get"* you by sharing moments of *`Hurt` (why you care)* and moments of *`Hope` (why you can)* along with the `Values` motivating your response.

Recall moments shared with the audience of `Hurt` and `Hope` and how they were responded to in a way that expresses shared `Values` 

Tell a story of accessing sources of courage to transform a moment of <code style="color : brown">Disruptive Threat</code> from a source of fear to an engaging challenge. <code style="color : brown">Thoughtless Reaction </code> into <code style="color : darkgreen">Mindful Response</code>.

> A narrative like this produces the capacity to respond conciously to loss, difference, domination, and change. AKA: The actions that cause outrage.

Mutually constructing individual and collective identities happens through coherent articulation of narrative moments.
- Pragmatic: How
- Narrative: Why

### The Power of Stories
<!--Pages 59 and 60-->

What stories have over lists to do's and don'ts:
- `Plot`: Disruption of norm, narrated response, resulting in outcome.
- `Character`: someone who can be identified with; protagonist.
- `Moral`: Experiential moral targeting head & heart with new lesson.

#### Origin Stories
Stories start from the beginning. Communicating values are best done with `learning moments` early in our life. They contain:
- `HURT`: Where we learned to care
- `HOPE`: Where we experienced our worth & value.
Beginnings of life often contain relatable challenges which transiate well across demographics, reducing separation.

#### FRAMEWORK not FORMULA

Order of elements (`Self`, `Us`, `Now`) can be chopped and changed to suit the narrative. Elements told via story moments contain sub-elements: `Challenge`, `Choice`, `Outcome`, & `Hope`.
> Awareness of story allows intentionality, skill, & learning.

### Practical Example of stories

>So far I have one example of trying to put this into practice

<summary>The First Treasurers report</summary>

### Context
After both the state and federal elections in Australia party business had resumed. Before the elections I was made treasurer of my local branch.

I had not been treasurer of anything before. With the introduction of new finance laws, combined with the fact training had not been for many months due to suspension of party business, *and* our disorganisation as people were either burned out or on holidays, there was not much direction or clarity for my position at the time.

The only thing I knew how to do was log into the finance system and read out how much we had in our account ($207.73) and give the treasurers report, which amounts to reading that number out.

In order to give myself some direction, I decided to use that treasurers report to create a narrative following the above rules.

### Making a narrative treasurers report
#### Content to communicate
I started by jotting down the content I needed to communicate, the `what`:

Finances --> Apologies --> Next Step

- Finances: our current balance was $207.73, and I have just recieved training from party office about how to handle our money.
- Apologies: I will be up north in Newman during the next meeting.
- Next Step: I want to do some social events to learn how to handle money, and I want to talk to every member about what they want to see the branch do.

#### Example of drafting the narrative
I then broke each of these sections down into their own `why me`, `why us`, and `why now` each containing stories of <code style="color : darkred">Hurt</code> and <code style="color : darkgreen">Hope </code>


**Example:**
>  `Next Step: Why me?`  
Last month, my car was broken into and my laptop was taken. This <code style="color : darkred">crushed</code> my motivation and so I failed to make the promised branch calls before this meeting. Despite this, I was still afforded time to think about our branch stratefy and study. This interim I have found both the avenue for us to question the party, and the <code style="color : darkgreen"> precise questions</code> I want us to ask ourselves.

> `Next Step: Why us?`  
Geraldton needs locals pushing and contributing to our cause. Without the voices of trusted members in out community advocating for our beliefs <code style="color : darkred">we will fail as a branch</code>, and further fail our electorate. Our jobs as believers in the cause is to find the respected members of our community, the aunty to everyone, the co-worker people trust and vent to, and 
ask them to represent out towns interests. If our branch is full of people who practice the principles and objectives of our party daily, the people that listen and make those around them heard, who try to raise everyone up, not just themselves, and understand the needs of the whole community, then <code style="color : darkgreen">achieving our goals will no longer be an uphill battle</code>, but will become a mere matter of doing what we already do a little more strategically.

> `Bext Step: Why now?`  
Our movement is founded at the grassroots. We win elections so the collective hopes of our community can be delivered. With less members in our party, we <code style="color : darkred">will faill</code> and lose our right to win. As a majority government party, if we use our power to deliver what Geraldton wants, by having trusted members in the branch advocating, then we won't just win the seat, we will bring wins to the future of our home.

I did not look over or edit this yet. I just wrote down what came to my mind until I managed to communicate <code style="color : darkred">Hurt</code> and <code style="color : darkgreen">Hope</code> with me, us, and now as the subject.  


You can tell given the long winded, comma riddled text that is the hallmark of how I write on the fly. I did this for every section I wanted to communicate.  

With the apologies I talked about wanting to go back to Newman where I grew up and talk to labor supporters while there, and for finances I talked about wanting to act on my new training and organise events.

#### Refining the narrative

My next step was to try convert every part of the report into one paragraph each, rather than 3 paragraphs each. So I rewrote each one in a way that combined `Me`, `Us`, and `Now` into one single paragraph.  
The next step was the longest, here is how it looked.

>`Next Step, Refined`  
Our movement is founded on large groups of people working together on solving our collective problems. To solve <code style="color : darkred">our issue of low participation</code><sup>`Us`</sup> I promised to call all brach memers, but my pain from having my car broken into <code style="color : darkred">deflated me</code><sup>`Me`</sup> and I failed this commitment. I was given time to reflect and study, instead, and am fully ready to commit with <code style="color : darkgreen">full confidence</code><sup>`Me`</sup> in figuring out who we are and what we want. We need to act now if we want build the confidence of the community to help us win, and that starts by making a plan that includes all of us. After <code style="color : darkgreen">we have clear goals in mind</code><sup>`Us & Now`</sup> we can recruit people with out values who want to see those goals achieved and collaborate on tactics that achieve them. Without a clear idea of who we are and how we operate, <code style="color : darkred">we will continue to decline</code><sup>`Now`</sup>

Still a bit long-winded, but much more nicely compacted into a single coherent paragraph than the first version. 

You can start to see that chopping and changing of order to suit the narrative now that things are getting mixed together. You have more <code style="color : darkred">Hurt</code> concentrated at the front, with some <code style="color : darkgreen">Hope</code> in the middle, and a final warning <code style="color : darkred">Hurt</code> at the end. 

This is just a treasurers report though, and the next step alone is a little bit long, let alone the addition of the apologies and finances which have also been given the same treatment.  

Lets rewrite everything again to be even more condensed as our final report.

#### The final report
>``Apologies:``
My homesickness has led me to Newman this week. Newman is a large part of the Durack electorate with a strong Labor history but unique challenges. Personally, I want to catch up with my old friends there, but I also want to see how our supporters are doing there. I regret not doing this before the election, as our two active volunteers fell ill just before the day and we had no backups. The second best time to visit is now though, so that’s where I am.

>``Balance and Finances:``
Our balance is still $207.73. We can't keep this stagnated when we know the opposition both out spend us and our only other campaign funds come from our widely spread party HQ. I've never been treasurer of anything before, But if we all practice our roles now, we will all have three years - or two diplomas worth - of experience to each draw from.

>``Next Step:``
Our movement is founded on collections of people collaborating solutions to our collective problems. Without this we will decline as a movement.
We have fewer members than when I first joined, and participation of members barely meets quorum. I promised to change this by calling every branch member before this meeting.
I failed this task. This month I was deflated after my car was broken into, and I lost enthusiasm for conversation.
Instead I studied and reflected, considering exactly what questions to ask. I am now more confident and motivated to call each member before the next branch meeting.
As a party in government, it's our time to push for the fairer future. Step one is finding out who we are, and what we think will make Geraldton fairer. When this is clarified, step two will be working to recruit those who practice our values and bring them into the branch, collaborating on tactics to achieve our goals, and show what we can do together. Each time we do this, we can achieve bigger and bigger things, of which election victory will be one.

This, combined with a list of powers I have as treasurer, and questions I want to ask each member, were what I submitted for the next branch meeting. The ultimate end result gave purpose to my holiday, and a clear, motivational reason to work on the action that will push the party forward (Calling all members before the next meeting).
