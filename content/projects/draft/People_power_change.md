## Emotion, Values, Leadership 

[^1] Decisions are based on value judgements which requires <mark>emotional information</mark>.
- Some emotions `enable` intention, mindfulness, and urgency
- some emotions `inhibit` intention, mindfulness, and agency.

Leaders goal is enabling others to be `motivated` enough by a disruption to result in `action` and make that action ` mindful` not `reactionary`.

Emotion, even negatives like anxiety, breaks habit. Consistency bias "It's always worked this way" and apathy "nothing we do works anyway" are disrupted by emotional shock.

### Urgency and Anger

The job of a leader in any movement is to activate people's need for urgent and intentional action, even when there is no apparent urgency and no clear conscious action.

Urgency establishes **priorities**. The two types of urgency are:
- URGENCY OF NEED: made when things are so bad that action is needed **now**
- URGENCY OF OPPORTUNITY: Made with **deadlines**. when you need to do something by a certain time for it to have an effect.

Anger counters Apathy and inertia via outrage.
> The world as it is rubbing up against the world as it should be.

Actions that cause outrage:
- Domination
- Discrimination
- Bullying
- Violation
- Neglect  

Regardless of how legitimate these actions appear to be, they will cause `outrage.`

Percieved destruction of values, moral traditions, and dignity are sources of anger that can motivate action
