## Emotion, Values, Leadership 
<!--Page 60-->
 Decisions are based on value judgements which requires <mark>emotional information</mark>.
- Some emotions `enable` intention, mindfulness, and urgency
- some emotions `inhibit` intention, mindfulness, and agency.

Leaders goal is enabling others to be `motivated` enough by a disruption to result in `action` and make that action ` mindful` not `reactionary`.

Emotion, even negatives like anxiety, breaks habit. Consistency bias "It's always worked this way" and apathy "nothing we do works anyway" are disrupted by emotional shock.

> EMOTION: MOTIVATES, BREAKS INERTIA, OVEROMES BIAS.

### Urgency and Anger
<!--Page 63-->

The job of a leader in any movement is to activate people's need for urgent and intentional action, even when there is no apparent urgency and no clear conscious action.

> this is done by pointing out contradictions in shared assumptions on how the world is, **agitation.**

Urgency establishes **priorities**. The two types of urgency are:
- URGENCY OF NEED: made when things are so bad that action is needed **now**
- URGENCY OF OPPORTUNITY: Made with **deadlines**. when you need to do something by a certain time for it to have an effect.

Anger counters Apathy and inertia via outrage.
> The world as it is rubbing up against the world as it should be.

Actions that cause outrage:
- Domination
- Discrimination
- Bullying
- Violation
- Neglect  

Regardless of how legitimate these actions appear to be, they will cause `outrage.`

Percieved destruction of values, moral traditions, and dignity are sources of anger that can motivate action

>`I have yet to really put these theories in action. If I do, I will add the example and how it went in practice here`

## Public Narrative
> <b> Why me? Why us? Why now? </b>

Everyones favorite part about politics, and what most people see it all as: Stories.

The reality is that people are far more likely to get with the program if they <i>"get"</i> you, the programmer.

You need to be able to tell a story of self that allows people to *"get"* you by sharing moments of *`Hurt` (why you care)* and moments of *`Hope` (why you can)* along with the `Values` motivating your response.

Recall moments shared with the audience of `Hurt` and `Hope` and how they were responded to in a way that expresses shared `Values` 

Tell a story of accessing sources of courage to transform a moment of <code style="color : brown">Disruptive Threat</code> from a source of fear to an engaging challenge. <code style="color : brown">Thoughtless Reaction </code> into <code style="color : aqua">Mindful Response</code>.

> A narrative like this produces the capacity to respond conciously to loss, difference, domination, and change. AKA: The actions that cause outrage.
