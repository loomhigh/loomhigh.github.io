## Benchmarks ##
### introduction ###
The Dell Vostro 3560 hails from the ripe days of 2012, hiding the wrinkles of its age with fine heinz tomato sauce. The sturdy build can handle rough and course sand of Malibu beaches, and its display has the glitz and glamour of a true starlet. The keyboard makes you a Maestro, this Vostro can play the night away to the rythm of your student Essay.

Of course its whats on the inside that counts, and rest assured this glitze an glamour is really a normal twenty teen aged girl, covering its computational bases with 8gb of RAM and an i5-3632QM Intel processor it can present 3.2GHz that tears the floor with 4 en cores. 
If I didn’t find out this machine was running Hannah Montanna Linux I wouldn’t have treated it quite the same (show footage of a laptop getting destroyed)

The posters don't say it all. To set the stage we have the biggest cheerleading squad a girlboss could ask for.
"Yarr I am pirate pete" *fitgirl music plays*


### Sims 4 ###

* Scene: On a pirate ship dressed as pirate pete

"are yee scurvy doge"
Qwerty: "hey, who are you calling doge"
"shut yer yap"
Let me tell you the famous pirate battle between old pirate pete and the famed scourge of the EA seas Captain Anadius, for the sacred treasure of Sims 4"
"This great game has raptured many a fair soul. In the Sims 4, you build your very own Lotus Hotel. Posessing this treasure is all fine and dandy, but the real question is, can it set sail in this old vessel of ours?"

“Lets see how it looks in the benchmarks”

### Borderlands 2 ###

* oppenheimer vibes

Next on the squad is borderlands 2. 
To really get the game to POP I started with an explosive exton build on medium settings. The life of a soldier is not a life of glory, one wonders what life would have been like if he never had to go AWOL, after blowing up those innocent people. He still wonders what made him do that? The glory? The game? Why live a double life when you can chose to end so many lives instead. *nuclear explosion*

Krieg: The Chaos and the yearning, moving, twitching, salivation. All to test its cartilage in the cockpit of battle! Colours and flavours so tasty, so BURNING. There is no greater princess than what came from the FIRE and AGONY and unvieled BLOOOD. 

Gaige: Why embrace the patriarchal order to middling two lives when you can live in total ANARCHY. With your new trusty hardware sidekick you can boast reliable framerates even with double bouncing bullets and the ultimate crime of half empty weapon clips.
It may take eyeshadow, a present father figure, and a life under the order of agents to become a true superstar, but when you embrace anarchy. When the shadows on your face are three bags full, when the only presence in your life is your own, and the only agency you obey is destruction, dismantlement, the basest of systems that no man can dominate over another. That is when you are a girlboss.

### Rimworld ###

Survival does not inherently depend on such vain luxuries as the 7500M Radeon GPU, which cuts through graphics like a bony little weed whacker. To live out there all you really need is a single core of your processor. With Rimworld we can see that in action. This little laptop, designed to manage its heat resources will strive to survive on maximum speed, and stoicly moderated Hetz.

### Doki Doki Literature club ##

Whats linux machine without Virtualisation functionality? Today we will try running RealityOS. This operating system uses an open BSD type kernel and its latest release, v2.1.2, is a proprietary fork developed by the FORAD corporation. As we can see the desktop environment boots up fine. Now RealityOS is meant to an immutable operating system, deleting files is not recommended and can cause weird bugs. Not to fret though as the Image does come with a Cutesy little dating game for us to test out. Anime adventures aren't quite my cup of tea, but for all you hopeless romantics out there it seems like a wonderful little adventure from the parts of it I have played.
