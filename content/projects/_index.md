Life for me is a myriad of volatile ideas, it is rare that they are seen to the end.

Here is an index of my projects and their status, both current and abandoned.

Each is linked to a personal project file, which is private and for my own reference.

## Active Projects
#### This website
>indeed, this website, given its incomplete nature and the very fact that the latest updates on the site are inherently from the site means this project is permanently active.

#### [Laos and Singkapo](Laos_Singkapo.md)

>A poetic recount of Pathet Lao Leader Singapo's escape from prison in 1960. Its been a while since I have made a video in this format, so its been in the backburner for a while.

#### [Stoicist Wags School](Stoicist_Wags_School.md)

>Small skit where someone uses stoic philosophy to justify avoiding homework

#### [People, Power, Change](People_Power_Change.md)
