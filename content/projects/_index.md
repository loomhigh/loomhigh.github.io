This page is a big ol' work in progress and should be considered incomplete, perhapse even containing a little misinformation as a treat :3

Life for me is a myriad of volatile ideas, it is rare that they are seen to the end.

Here is an index of my projects and their status, both current and abandoned.

Each is linked to a personal project file, which is private and for my own reference.

## Active Projects
#### This website
>indeed, this website, given its incomplete nature and the very fact that the latest updates on the site are inherently from the site means this project is permanently active.

## Prospective projects
#### centralised resources for activist groups
>I want to create a github repository that contains all the online resources needed to set up and maintain community groups, and importantly: has easy to follow instructions for it. Things like volunteer management, website deployment, etc. I lack any hope of doing it, but I certainly like the idea.

## Hibernating 

#### [Laos and Singkapo](https://hackmd.io/@loomhigh/HJBqnOmbkx)

>A poetic recount of Pathet Lao Leader Singapo's escape from prison in 1960. Its been a while since I have made a video in this format, so its been in the backburner for a while.

#### [Wanneroo high school traditions](https://hackmd.io/@loomhigh/SJsLu5ngye)

>I have been told stories of many weird high school traditions and wanted to make a funny video detailing them all. As you can imagine, this video is not a high priority

#### [Carr Boyd the Qld Rascal](https://hackmd.io/Bxf_G3cdRvy9t6HyKFQ_Cg?view)

>I remember reading something about him in the book "Kings in Grass Castles" but do not remember the details. Might get to it in the distant future, might not

#### [Stoicist Wags School](https://hackmd.io/@loomhigh/SJHZLc3ekg)
