I grew up in a remote mining town in Australia's Pilbara region. It was a transient place. People moved in and out of town so frequently that I rarely knew people for more than a couple years. I didn't have a computer or internet at home. I found joy in the resources the local Library offered me. I learned a lot from the resources of the internet. Eventually the tools made by Open Source development would provide me with a true chance to explore creatively. to feel can do anything with sufficient effort. The local history books and online knowledge let me put my own little world into perspective too.

half of the planets Iron Ore are mined around my region. At least a trillion dollars worth since 1990. Yet companies like BHP pay little to no tax for it, have worked to break attempts to improve quality of life in towns since the 70s, and subverted the growth of local communities with Fly-In-Fly-Out workers and camps. These facts become more frustrating with the knowledge that these mines were meant to be nationalised, with all profits going to the country. Corporate ownership, an allergy to community interest, is why in 65 years when the ore is gone, so will my home town. I learned that the effort you take to make things work can be taken and put behind a paywall, used by someone else as leverage if they can occupy and own it. Right now this same pattern is seen in tech.

 I believe that in the realm of software, there is a special potential for subversion, because unlike rocks and chips, software is intangible. 

 competent tech policy only happens with a government full of people with tech knowledge. If we want to have a free and open digital world with reliable employment, and tech designed for people rather than profit, we need to organise and participate. Unionization, joining political parties, making inquiry submissions. Finding how change happens and making it happen: Organising.
