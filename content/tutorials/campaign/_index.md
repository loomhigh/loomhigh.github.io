### what is here?

Within this section of the site there should be all the resources a growing committee enjoyer should need to set up a system of organisation as cheaply and reliably as possible.

Hopefully included would be document templates, easily usable software, and other bits and bops to get you going in your little organisational journey.

Most of these Tutorials will come from my experiences working for organisations, volunteering in political parties, and running the Perth Linux Users Group.

## Political campaigns? In my non-political FOSS movement? Shrimply impossible!

Some say that the open source movement is "non-political" and should stay that way.  
Much like the concept of being "unbiased" such an idea is nice in concept but in reality, a self told fallacy.  
Everyone is biased, our opinions are informed by our background, and not acknowledging that leaves us vulnerable to ignorance.  

The Free and Open Source movement has an effect on the way the world works.   
Software is a tool. The control of tools, what economists would generally consider one of the "means of production", is an extremely political subject.  
If you believe in the Open Source movement, that people have the right to create software that anyone can use for any reason they wish (with attribution), then you are asserting a political belief.  

### Where does that put FOSS?
With this acknowledgement that the Open Source Movement is inherently Political, where do we align ourselves compared to the other movements out there?  

I assert that FOSS is inherently a Community organisation with a grassroots foundation.  
FOSS does have a fairly unique link to corporations. Some of its biggest contributions are by Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft; multi-billion dollar companies.  
But ultimately, a world without FOSS won't mean a world without those conglomerates, it would mean a world where we have no hope competing against conglomerates.  

The biggest Competitors against the biggest tech companies use Linux. Some are very large, Canonical[^4] and Valve[^5] being worth Millions and Billions respectively.  

However, of the 10 Major Linux Distributions (Plus OpenBSD) on [Distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major), the Majority are Community run. Two notable ones, the stable Debian and customizable Arch, are what Canonical's Ubuntu and Valve's SteamOS are respectively based on.

## Bringing control back to communities. Why being part of the world is so important

The Free and Open Source Software community puts in a lot of work to enable people to use devices as they wish, but there are a lot of ways the world is structured that slows down progress immensely.

One example, is how difficult it is to load alternative Operating systems to Phones. Mobile phones are some of the most power efficient and petite computers ever created. Their ARM architecture is the second most supported behind x86, and there are endless examples of what can be done with that chipset using a rasberry pi.  

However, enigmatic and proprietary firmware, coupled with difficult or impossible to unlock bootloaders make installing and supporting these devices - despite the best efforts of projects like PostmarketOS[^6] - very difficult. When you combine These factors with the additional 'feature' of some activation lock, where devices can't be reset without unlocking the device, you can cripple the second hand handset market, and destine devices with powerful chips that are typically too small to economically recycle to E-waste.

Despite the technical complications that arise from these issues, they can be medicated with relatively simple policy by government\*. Requiring devices be unlockable by the user, allowing device to be wiped after prolonged inactivity, and an overall policy agenda that seeks to separate control of hardware and software markets so that today's technology can be used however the user wants, and not the way its creator requires.

\* Big emphasis on "relatively". Policy is a very complicated thing, and there will likely be many roadblocks and exceptions found along the way. Relative to the other convoluted issues government has been made to manage, firmware requirements would be simple.

### "Government? I don't trust government!"

This is the most common response I get from people within the Open Source Community. 

It is an understandable position. We hear about a lot of things done under the perview of a government that is abhorrent: Massacres[^7], Torture, Breaches of privacy, and seemingly ham fisted regulations that look to do more harm than good.

Recent examples of these in the Australian context that have particularly angered FOSS is the [3G network shutdown](https://medium.com/@jamesdwho/australias-3g-shutdown-why-your-4g-5g-phone-is-now-blocked-5900cd5361e2) and [Online Safety Amendment.]()

#### Government isn't a beast, but a battleground

When we look at examples of government action, we see two sides of them. One side is your NSA and Guantanimo Bay; your Pine Gap and Dismissals. Books like [Manufacturing Consent]()[^1] and [Dark Money]()[^2] illistrate how these institutions have been built, maintained, and used at the beheast of rich and powerful individuals driven to maintain and strengthen their position at the top of the material hierarchy. 

What these types of books brush on, and is especially pointed out in [The Big Myth]()[^3], is that these were battles. Each dollar spent to pave the way for more oil fields there were groups that fought to push those plans back. For over a century, every remotely decent policy made by government is a result of advocacy by groups. By far the biggest is unions, creating the weekend, the 8 hour day, and in some countries far far more.

Government is not an entity making decisions for us, it is where the battle between community and oligarchy is fought. If we truly want Free and Open Source Software to exist we need to be there in the trenches with the rest of the community groups out there working hard to create a world where we can reach our fullest potential in the ways we see fit.

That is why this section exists, to help us do that.

[^6]: PostmarketOS is a project to bring mainline (non-android) Linux to phones. They have already bought support to dozens of devices, but the vast majority still lack suitable support, and a majority of that majority have no support at all.

[^7]: For some potent examples of government enabled massacres, I suggest the book ["The Jakarta Method"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jakarta_Method) by Vincent Bevins. A depressing read to be sure, but nevertheless important to keep in mind.
