### what is here?

Within this section are all the resources I've made for organising and campaigning as cheaply and reliably as possible.

Hopefully including templates, easily usable software, and other bits and bops to help your group advocate for whatever cause they believe in.

Most of these Tutorials will come from my experiences working for organisations, volunteering in political parties, and running the Perth Linux Users Group.

## Political campaigns? In my non-political FOSS movement? Shrimply impossible! 🦐

Some reckon the open source movement is "non-political" and should stay that way.  
Like being "unbiased", such an idea is nice in concept but in reality, a self told fallacy.  
Everyone is biased, our opinions are informed by our background and beliefs, not acknowledging that leaves us vulnerable to ignorance.  

The Free and Open Source movement has an effect on the way the world works.   
Software is a tool. The control of tools, what economists would generally consider one of the "means of production", is an extremely political subject.  
If you believe in the Open Source movement, that people have the right to create software that anyone can use for any reason they wish (with attribution), then you are asserting a political belief.  

### Where does that put FOSS?
Acknowledgement that the Open Source Movement is inherently Political, where do we align ourselves compared to the other movements out there?  

I assert that FOSS is community oriented with a grassroots foundation.  

Of course, FOSS does have strong links to corporate powers, with some of its biggest contributions coming from multi-billion dollar conglomerates like Microsoft and Google.  

However, the most notable Competitors of the big five Tech Titans use FOSS like Linux, the biggest being Canonical[^4] and Valve[^5], worth Millions and Billions respectively.  

Additionally, of the 10 Major Linux Distributions (Plus OpenBSD) on [Distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major), the Majority are Community run. Two notable ones: the stable Debian and customizable Arch, are what Canonical's Ubuntu and Valve's SteamOS are respectively based on.

Ultimately, a world without FOSS won't mean a world without those conglomerates, it would mean a world where we have no hope competing against conglomerates. These tools are maintained by communities, and enables those without the power to produce similar tools to compete against established powers like the Tech Giants.  

## Bringing control back to communities. Why being part of the world is so important

The Free and Open Source Software community puts in a lot of work to enable people to use devices as they wish, but there are a lot of ways the world is structured that slows down progress immensely.

One example is phones. These are some of the most power efficient and petite computers ever mass produced. Their ARM architecture is the second most supported behind x86, and endless examples of the chipset's reusability have been displayed by devices like the Raspberry Pi.  

However, enigmatic and proprietary firmware, coupled with difficult or impossible to unlock bootloaders make installing and supporting these devices - despite the best efforts of projects like PostmarketOS[^6] - very difficult. When you combine These factors with the additional 'feature' of some activation lock, where devices can't be reset without unlocking the device, you can cripple the second hand handset market, and destine devices typically too small and tedious to properly and profitably recycle to landfill.

Despite the technical complications that arise from these issues, relatively simple policy by government can provide remedy\*. Requiring devices be unlockable by the user, enabling them to be wiped after prolonged inactivity, and an overall policy agenda that seeks to separate control of hardware and software markets so that today's technology can be used to its fullest extent.

\* Big emphasis on "relatively". Policy is a very complicated thing, and there will likely be many roadblocks and exceptions found along the way. Relative to the other convoluted issues government has been made to manage, firmware requirements would be simple.

### "Government? I don't trust government!"

This is the most common response I get from people within the Open Source Community.  

It is an understandable position. Government are the monopoly of violence. Countless things done under the perview of a government has been abhorrent: Massacres[^7], Torture, Breaches of privacy, and seemingly ham fisted regulations that look to do more harm than good.  

Recent examples of regulations in the Australian context that have particularly angered FOSS is the 3G network shutdown[^8] and Online Safety Amendment.[^9]  

#### 3G network Shutdown
The shutdown of Australia's 3G Network was riddled with criticism that was not effectively addressed by government.   

The transition from 3G to 4G - although different to the transition from 2G to 3G - was an innevitability. Many countries were slowly transitioning away from the old technology.  
What distinctly did not have to happen, was for a complete nationwide shutdown, with a move to non-standardised VoLTE technology, and unchecked power provided to the biggest phone retailers to block any devices from mobile networks.  
To add insult to Injury, one of the few requirements the government mandated these telecommunications companies implement was blocking all devices deemed incapable of accessing the 4G network.  
[The Minister of Communications](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TFVftFz9XWpM3bc6hV4Pjtz1umXWBNsr/view), in their response to constituent James Parker's concerns stated that Phone identification methodologies have been conducted based on industry practices, but because that industry is highly concentrated, common practice is already deeply interwoven with conflicting interest of selling handsets.  

What is important to highlight here, is how little this was pointed out by anyone. Of the 46 items submitted to the Senate Committee, [Mr James Parker](https://medium.com/@jamesdwho/australias-3g-switch-off-failures-of-government-industry-to-prepare-b621f90f7950#f486) a computer repair enthusiast, was the only one to stress these concerns.  

There is a lot to criticise about the government's handling of the shutdown, but I think there is a lot left to be desired about the FOSS community that there was no organised attempts to bring this to the governments attention.  
How do we expect elected members of parliment to make the correct decision when 90% of the people giving them expert advice in the field of Information Technology are representatives of large Tech Conglomerates. Where were the submissions? The publicisation? The Internal motions by political involved tech enthusiasts? I wouldn't be surprised if I was the only one to push a motion within Labor about this strengthening of telco market domination.  

You will likely lose most battles you fight, but if no one even tries, then you will definitely lose all of them.

#### Online Safety Amendment
Online safety bill met highly publicised criticism, and there were a lot of good reasons why. As pointed out in the submission by ARC[^9] blanket bans social media for youth would only move young people towards more obscure places on the internet.  
On a personal level, Social media is one factor that sublimented the small social circles I had growing up in a remote mining town. This sentiment was common especially in the senate committee submissions by youth and minority oriented groups. Here is an example, a submission by [Pride in Swan](https://prideinswan.org/):  
> For many vulnerable youth, particularly those from the LGBTIQA+SB community, social
media is far more than a digital pastime, it is a critical lifeline. It is often the only way they
can connect with others who share their experiences, access affirming spaces, and find
support networks that validate their identities.

#### Government isn't a beast, but a battleground

When we look at examples of government action, we see two sides of them. One side is your NSA and Guantanimo Bay; your corporate bailouts and big sellouts. Books like ++Manufacturing Consent++[^1] and ++Dark Money++[^2] illustrate how these institutions have been built, maintained, and used at the beheast of rich and powerful groups driven to maintain and strengthen their position at the top of the material hierarchy. 

What these types of books brush on, and is especially pointed out in ++The Big Myth++[^3], is that these were to some degree contested events. Every time action was taken at the expense of the majority of people, communities resisted that action. For over a century, every remotely decent policy made by government is a result of advocacy by grassroots groups. By far the biggest is unions, with the creation the weekend and the 8 hour day in many countries, in some countries, far far more.

Government is not an entity making decisions for us, it is where the battle between community and oligarchy is fought. If we truly want Free and Open Source Software to exist we need to be there in the trenches with the wider community of people out there working hard for a world where we can reach our fullest potential in the ways *we* see fit.

That is why this section exists, to help us do that.

[^5]: Probably needing no footnote, Valve is the largest video game company in the world. They started by developing video games, most notably the half life series, but have primarily garnered power through absolutely dominating the Video Game distribution market through Steam. Within the past few years, Valve has begun succeeding in the gaming hardware market through the Steam Deck, who's linux-based SteamOS looks to compete with Windows as a gaming PC operating system.

[^6]: PostmarketOS is a project to bring mainline (non-android) Linux to phones. They have already bought support to dozens of devices, but the vast majority still lack suitable support, and a majority of that majority have no support at all.

[^7]: For some potent examples of government enabled massacres, I suggest the book ["The Jakarta Method"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jakarta_Method) by Vincent Bevins. A depressing read to be sure, but nevertheless important to keep in mind.
