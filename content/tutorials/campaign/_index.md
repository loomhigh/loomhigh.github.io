### what is here?

Within this section of the site there should be all the resources a growing committee enjoyer should need to set up a system of organisation as cheaply and reliably as possible.

Hopefully included would be document templates, easily usable software, and other bits and bops to get you going in your little organisational journey.

Might be quite sparse for a while until I get the hang of things, but eventually, you will see some neato advice here.
