title: How to make a can Roll in Blender
---

## Preamble
One day I spent way too long figuring out how to simply make a can roll in blender. Kept sliding around on the ground like its lubed up with DR.Pepper flavoured slickeners. Eventually I found a simple way to do it, and wanted to make sure it was on the internet for the next weird loser that wanted to make a can roll in blender for whatever reason. Because you it's can, you can, after all.
