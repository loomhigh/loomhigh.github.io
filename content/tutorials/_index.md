## Tutorials
Here are attempts to turn my meandering and misc-directed life into useful instructions for internet people.

[Production Tutorials](production.md)
> Instructions in all things video making, animating, and possibly even filming (I hate that part)

[Linux Tutorials](linux.md)
> anything Linux, possibly even GNU/Linux whatever that means. I am by no means good with it, but hopefully that just means I can make digestable content

[Campaign Resources](campaign.md)
> tools, resources, and instructions for advocating your interests, and running grassroots groups.
