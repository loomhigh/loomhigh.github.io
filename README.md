## draft loomhigh website

### Development

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site built to run on [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages/).

### Getting Started

#### Requirements

* Hugo (extended edition)

#### Migration

Initially forked from the Perth Linux User Group guthub repo. Still in the process of converting it to my devious purposes

As some of the html used on the current website is non standard,
running a html -> markdown task gives unsatisfactory results.

#### Running Locally

Run Hugo with `hugo serve`.

If you are on a PLUG dev box and want to access the site publicly, run `hugo serve --bind 0.0.0.0`
