## Draft loomhigh website
Forked from the Perth Linux User Group website. Being adjusted so that it can be used as the basis of a personal website, and to create a template for future basic sites.

### Development

I do not know how to run this thing. The original source I forked it from says to use Hugo. IDK if this thing uses hugo, It lives on hopes, dreams, and rizz.
