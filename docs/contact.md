The best way to contact PLUG is:
* by e-mail; or
* attend any of our in-person [events](/events/_index.md) in Western Australia - usually Perth, but many of us are up for a road trip to meet with our regional friends

If you are asking a Linux related question, you should subscribe to the [PLUG email mailing list](http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/plug) (free) and ask your question to the general members; you're welcome to unsubscribe at any time should you wish to.

You can send the PLUG Committee an email [committee@plug.org.au](mailto:committee@plug.org.au). The committee and its subcommittees are responsible for the administration and website of the association.
